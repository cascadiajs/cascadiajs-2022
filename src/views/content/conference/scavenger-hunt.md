Kelsey Breseman ([previous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgvIphYgT_E)) made an orienteering map of Sunriver Resort in order to set a score-orienteering course for participants. After brief first-timer instruction in the sport of orienteering, orientation to the map, and instructions on scoring, participants raced to score the most points by navigating to various sites.

Participants impressed, returning sweat-soaked but triumphant, in as little as [thirty minutes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WdHZbq0h1ViGUhhdN_NYr0XIW3dH2C8PS-U_pF2KoY0/edit#gid=0) with the full 260 possible points.
