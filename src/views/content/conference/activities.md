All in-person conference attendees will have the opportunity to RSVP for one of the following during our Activity Track on the afternoon of August 31. Make sure you [get your Conference Ticket](/tickets) and [RSVP](/home/dashboard) soon, because spaces are limited! A few notes:

- Activities run from roughly 4pm - 6pm, but timing may change per Activity.
- Activities are only open to Attendees and Guests, but we have only reserved kayaks and bikes for attendees. Guests who want to reserve and pay for their own kayaks/bikes are welcome to join!
- See equipment requirements for each activity.

<h2>Kayaking by <img src="/images/sponsors/netlify.svg"/></h2>

Our friends at [Netlify](/sponsors/netlify) have reserved a block of single and double kayaks! Folks will head over to the Marina, check-out their gear and paddle down the Deschutes River. Here are details on how kayaking will work:

- Shuttles to Marina will pickup folks at the Main Lodge and depart at **3pm**
- The ride down the river is one way and can take **2:15 to 3 hours** to complete. 
- There is a clearly marked pickup point where you will be brought back to the Marina and then shuttled back over to the Lodge, hopefully in time for dinner!

So, this is by far the most intense activity and will require you to leave the conference a little early and arrive for dinner a little late, but promises to be worth it.

<h2>Scavenger Hunt by <img src="/images/sponsors/begin.svg"/></h2>

Our Activity Lead, Kelsey Breseman, loves to go Orienteering and has devised an amazing Scavenger Hunt that will require speed and wits. She's literally been doing this since she was 8...

Our friends at [Begin](/sponsors/begin) will have some surprises in store as well, so don't miss out!

<h2>Sunriver Bike Ride by <img src="/images/sponsors/web3-storage.png"/></h2>

If you're looking for a guided ride, Christian Danielsen will lead a group from the Bike Barn for a mellow, 1-hour circuit around the resort. Beginner friendly, all abilities welcome! The perfect place for cruising with your new friends at CascadiaJS. 

Bikes will be provided, but you can always bring your own.

## Yoga üèîüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®

Unwind from a day of talks and networking with some yoga on the lawn with Ginger Lee of [Sisters Yoga Outside](http://www.shakatownyoga.com/). You'll be supported by the cool grass and warmth of the sun, moving to the rhythm of your breath and sounds of the birds... and most likely a fire playlist.

Please plan on bringing your own yoga mat or beach towel.

## Bike to Benham Falls üö≤

This is a roughly 14-mile ride out to Benham Falls being led by Eric Artzt, a ride leader in the local Bend biking community. He promises this will be a fantastic Central Oregon experience!

The trails are either paved or gently rolling singletrack. The route is mostly flat with about 300 feet of accumulated climbing. We're still working on finalizing the route, but we expect getting out and back will take roughly 2 hours.

You will need to bring your own bike, or [reserve one](https://www.sunriverresort.com/activities/bike-rentals-family-paved-trails-perfect-for-learning-how-to-ride-a-bike) through the Bike Barn at Sunriver Resort.

## Nature Walk üå≤

![Carter and Otto](/images/organizers/carter-otto.jpg)

This will be a gentle walk through some of the prettier parts of Sunriver, led by Lead Organizer Carter Rabasa and his trusty sidekick Otto the Labradoodle. 

This walk will be designed to be kid-friendly and dog-friendly and probably not be more than 2 miles or so.
