## Where is Sunriver Resort?

![Sunriver Resort overhead](/images/sunriver/sunriver-overhead.jpg)

Sunriver Resort is located just outside of Bend, OR. Located on the east side of the Cascade Mountains, it is bright and sunny well into September. It is driving distance from Portland, OR and an airport (RMA) is located 40 minutes away from the Resort.

This year’s event is designed to be a Destination Event, and we expect the quality of our speakers and our attendees to reflect that. This will be a “must attend” conference for many of the best web developers in the area.

## Why Sponsor?

CascadiaJS has been a pillar of the JavaScript and web communities in the Pacific Northwest for over 10 years. Past sponsors include Microsoft, Mozilla, Google, Salesforce, Twilio and dozens of other companies who have supported our community and our events over the years. Our event and sponsorships are designed to support 3 main business goals: 

### <i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> Recruiting 

Get in front of the hundreds of JavaScript and web developers, and spread the word about your current openings. We attract all kinds of developers, from junior devs all the way up to Engineering leaders at some of the world’s most innovative companies.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-megaphone"></i> Developer Marketing

Get the word out about your product or service to folks who are motivated to learn and pick-up tools that can help them solve their company’s biggest problems. This is a fantastic audience for companies that ship developers tools, devops tools, service APIs, and application hosting platforms.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smiling-hands"></i> Community

The Pacific Northwest JavaScript community is strong, but we need the continuous support of companies in our industry to make CascadiaJS accessible to as many people, and as many different kinds of people, as possible.

## Who Attends?

CascadiaJS attracts a diverse group of people from across the Pacific Northwest and beyond. There is a healthy mix of folks in different stages of their career and our Scholarship Program helps us make sure that our conference better reflects the kind of people we want to see in our industry.
